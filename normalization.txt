key attribute : The attribute with the help which we can identify the record uniquely.
non key attribute :All the attributes except key attributes is called non-key attribute.
prime key attribute : among the key attribute  ,an attribute which we choosen to identify the record uniquely in a table .
composite key : the combination of two or more key attributes which is used to identify a record uniquely .
super key:  The set of all the key attributes is known as super key attribute .
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Functional Dependency : -
_____________________
A  relation which exists such that attributes determines another attribute uniquely i.e known as functional dependency.
	R->{X,Y}	X->DETERMINANT Y->DEPENDENT 
There are three types functional dependency : 

1.Total FD
2.Partial FD
3.Transitive FD

Total Functional Dependency : 
____________________________  	If all the attributes of a relation determined by a key attribute i.e known as Total FD .
				 R ->{A,B,C,D}
				  A->B,
				  A->C,
				  A->D 
Partial Functional Dependency :
_____________________________       	A relation set has partial functional dependency ,
					1.It consists a composite key attribute
					2.There exists a dependency such that an attribute can be determined by other attribute which is a
					part of composite key attribute.
				R->{A,B,C,D}
				{A,B}->{C,D}
				{B}->{C}
				{A,B}->{D}
Transitive Functional dependency :
_______________________________ A relation set have a transitive functional dependency if there exists a relation such that an attribute is determined
	by non-key attribute which in term is determined by key attribute .
			R ->{A,B,C,D}
			A->B
			B->C 
			so A->C

NORMALIZATION  : 
_________________ 
			The process of decomposing the table into smaller table in order to remove rdundancy and anomoly by identifying 
dependencies . or The process of reducing    the table into its normal form .

Normal Forms : -
	A state of table without redundancy and anomoly is known as normal form
Anomolys : - The problem which occur during DML operations 
Types :-
First Normal Form : -
____________________
			A table is set to be in 1NF  ,if it satisfy the following conditions :
				1.A table should not contain duplicate records .
				2.Every cell in the table should have single value(Atomic value) .
SecondNormal Form :-
_____________________  	A table is set to be in 2NF  ,if it satisfy the following conditions :
				1.A table should be in  FirstNormal Form
				2.Table should not contain partial functional dependency. 
Third Normal Form :-
_____________________
	1.It should satisfy the second normal form
	2.Should not contain transitive functional dependency
